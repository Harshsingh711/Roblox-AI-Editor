# OpenAI API Quota Information

## Current Situation

Your OpenAI API key has exceeded its quota limit. This is common with the free plan, which has limited credits.

## What This Means

- ✅ **You can still use the code editor** - All file editing features work normally
- ✅ **You can still browse and organize files** - File explorer works perfectly
- ✅ **You can still write and save Lua code** - Monaco editor is fully functional
- ❌ **AI features are temporarily unavailable** - Code generation and suggestions won't work

## Solutions

### Option 1: Wait for Quota Reset
- Free plan quotas typically reset monthly
- Check your OpenAI dashboard for reset date
- No action needed, just wait

### Option 2: Add Credits
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Navigate to Billing → Payment methods
3. Add payment method and credits
4. Credits are pay-as-you-go, very affordable

### Option 3: Upgrade Plan
- Consider upgrading to a paid plan
- More generous quotas and better models
- Starts at $5/month for basic usage

## Using the Editor Without AI

The editor is still fully functional for:
- Writing and editing Lua/Luau code
- Organizing project files
- Syntax highlighting and auto-completion
- File management and navigation

## Alternative AI Options

If you want AI assistance while waiting:
1. **GitHub Copilot** - Works with VS Code
2. **Cursor Editor** - Built-in AI features
3. **Claude Desktop** - Anthropic's AI assistant
4. **Local AI models** - Run AI locally (advanced)

## Cost Estimate

For typical Roblox development:
- **Embeddings**: ~$0.01 per 1,000 tokens
- **Code generation**: ~$0.01-0.05 per request
- **Monthly usage**: Usually $1-5 for active development

## Quick Test

To check if your quota has reset:
```bash
node test-api.js
```

This will tell you if the API is working again.
