# File Operations Guide

Your Roblox AI Editor now supports powerful file operations that allow the AI to create, modify, and delete files to build complete features!

## üöÄ New Capabilities

The AI can now:
- **Create new files** with proper content
- **Modify existing files** with updates
- **Delete files** when no longer needed
- **Create directories** for proper project structure
- **Handle complex multi-file features** like complete game mechanics

## üìù How It Works

### Simple Code Modifications
For simple changes to existing files, the AI returns the updated file content directly.

**Example prompt:** "Add a jump mechanic to the player script"

### Complex File Operations
For features requiring multiple files, the AI returns a JSON structure with file operations.

**Example prompt:** "Create a simple obby game with checkpoints"

The AI will return something like:
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "type": "create",
      "path": "Scripts/ObbyGame.lua",
      "content": "-- Obby game main script\nlocal Players = game:GetService('Players')\n..."
    },
    {
      "type": "create", 
      "path": "LocalScripts/ObbyUI.lua",
      "content": "-- UI script for obby game\nlocal Players = game:GetService('Players')\n..."
    },
    {
      "type": "modify",
      "path": "Scripts/TestScript.lua", 
      "content": "-- Updated test script with obby integration\n..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## üéÆ Example Prompts

Try these prompts to test the new capabilities:

### Simple Modifications
- "Add a health system to the player"
- "Fix the collision detection in the movement script"
- "Add comments to explain the code"

### Complex Features
- "Create a simple obby game with checkpoints and leaderboard"
- "Add a shop system with currency and items"
- "Create a basic FPS game with weapons and health"
- "Build a tycoon game with building mechanics"
- "Add a chat system with commands"

### Project Structure
- "Create a proper Roblox project structure with Scripts, LocalScripts, and ReplicatedStorage folders"
- "Organize the code into modules and services"

## üîß How to Use

1. **Open your Roblox project folder** in the editor
2. **Type your request** in the AI panel
3. **Review the generated operations** (if any)
4. **Click "Apply All File Operations"** to execute the changes
5. **The file explorer will refresh** to show new files

## üìÅ File Paths

The AI uses relative paths from your project root:
- `Scripts/` - Server scripts
- `LocalScripts/` - Client scripts  
- `ReplicatedStorage/` - Shared resources
- `StarterGui/` - UI elements
- `StarterPlayer/` - Player-related scripts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Backup your project** before applying complex operations
- **Review the operations** before applying them
- **The AI creates proper Roblox folder structures**
- **All operations are relative to your project root**
- **The file explorer automatically refreshes** after operations

## üéØ Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** about what you want to create
2. **Mention file types** if you have preferences (Scripts vs LocalScripts)
3. **Include context** about your existing code
4. **Ask for complete features** rather than just code snippets

## üîÑ What Happens After Operations

- New files appear in the file explorer
- Modified files are updated in the editor
- Deleted files are removed from the project
- The project structure is automatically refreshed
- You can immediately start editing the new files

This makes your editor as powerful as Cursor for building complete Roblox features!
